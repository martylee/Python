The folder contains two python files.
For the first time, run create.py to create a new table named domains which holds a daily count of email addresses by their domain name.User need to modify the connect_to_database function in order to access the
database.
Then if domains table exists, just run domain.py and it will report the top 50 domains by count sorted 
by percentage growth of the last 30 days compared to the total as standard output.
